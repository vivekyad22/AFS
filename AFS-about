AFS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Andrew File System (AFS)[1] is a distributed file system
which uses a set of trusted servers to present a homogeneous, location-transparent file name space to all the client workstations.
It was developed by Carnegie Mellon University as part of the Andrew Project.[2] It is named after Andrew Carnegie and Andrew Mellon. 

AFS[3] has several benefits over traditional networked file systems, particularly in the areas of security and scalability.
AFS uses Kerberos for authentication, and implements access control lists on directories for users and groups.
Each client caches files on the local filesystem for increased speed on subsequent requests for the same file.
This also allows limited filesystem access in the event of a server crash or a network outage.
Read and write operations on an open file are directed only to the locally cached copy. When a modified file is closed, the changed portions are copied back to the file server. 
Cache consistency is maintained by callback mechanism. When a file is cached, the server makes a note of this and promises to inform the client if the file is updated by someone else.
